Arrays are sequential lists of data; they're fast

Pointer structures are lists of items that may be spread across memory
	Linked list, trees
	beneficial: sequential storage space not requires, canbegin quite small and arbitrarily grow as more nodes are added
	cost: e.g. integer list, each node will take space of integer plus an extra integer to store pointer
	endpoint: instead of Null, in Py None.
	Keep the distinction between data and node in mind: if node has customer data in it, need a Customer class to store data
